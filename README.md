# Weather Application
This is a weather application that is still a work in progress. 

This application is being programmed in Kotlin that pulls live data from an API provided by https://openweathermap.org/api. I am applying the object-oriented paradigm and data structures such as lists and maps. Additionally, it'll utilize the Model-view-ViewModel software architectural pattern. The most recent version was an update that implemented Android's Navigation component.

All of the classes for this project can be found via app/src//main/java/com/example/ryangallagher for each branch. Drawables, navigation, and layout xml can be found via app/src/main/res/ for each branch.
